Generics-based efficient binary serialisation/deserialisation

This has its origins in a system designed to stream data efficiently
in and out (using lazy `ByteString`s), and has thus been implemented
in a fashion to not only be fast but also use little memory in
overhead.

Theseus managed to escape the labyrinth (albeit with insider help).
Anything else regarding the name is an in-joke (if "joke" is the
correct term).
